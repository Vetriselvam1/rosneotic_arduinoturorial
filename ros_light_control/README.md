Here's an updated version of your README.md with a bold emphasis on the most important lines, such as key commands and steps:

# ROS Light Control

This repository contains a ROS-based light control system where you can control an LED using different methods such as **ON**, **OFF**, and **BLINK**. The project uses ROS Noetic and supports both visualization in RViz and control via command-line arguments.

## Features

- **ON**: Turns the LED ON.
- **OFF**: Turns the LED OFF.
- **BLINK**: Makes the LED blink continuously.

### Components

1. **ROS Noetic**: The main framework for controlling the system.
2. **Arduino**: Controls the LED hardware.
3. **RViz**: Used to visualize the LED status (**ON**, **OFF**, or **BLINK**).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Install ROS Noetic** on your machine (if not already installed).  
   Follow the instructions at: [ROS Noetic Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)

2. **Install Arduino IDE** to upload the code to your Arduino board:  
   [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### Build the package

1. Navigate to your ROS workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    ```

2. Build your workspace:
    ```bash
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
    cd src
    ```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vetriselvam1/rosneotic_arduinoturorial.git
cd rosneotic_arduinoturorial

Upload the Arduino code

    Open the Arduino IDE, and select the correct board and port.
    Upload the code from src/led_control.ino to your Arduino.

Usage
Run ROS Nodes

    Start the ROS master:

roscore

Run the Arduino ROS Node:

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0

Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your Arduino port.

Run the LED control node:

    rosrun ros_light_control ros_ledcontrol_node <command>

    Replace <command> with:
        ON to turn the LED on.
        OFF to turn the LED off.
        BLINK to make the LED blink.

Before Visualization, start the following:

Run the RViz LED control node:

rosrun ros_light_control rviz_ledcontrol_node

Start RViz:

    In a new terminal, run:

rosrun rviz rviz

In RViz, add a Marker display type and select the topic visualization_marker.

You should see the LED's status change according to the command sent (ON, OFF, or BLINK).
